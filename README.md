To create a Sudoku solver with a graphical user interface (GUI), we can use the tkinter library in Python. This implementation will allow the user to input the Sudoku puzzle, solve it using the backtracking algorithm, and display the solution on the GUI.

Here's how to do it:

Create the GUI layout: Use tkinter to create the grid where users can input their Sudoku puzzle. Implement the Sudoku solver: Use the backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. Connect the GUI to the solver: Solve the puzzle when the user clicks a button and display the solution.

SudokuSolverGUI class: This class handles the GUI and the logic for solving the Sudoku puzzle.

init method: Initializes the GUI window and creates the grid of cells where users can input numbers.
create_grid method: Creates a 9x9 grid of tk.Entry widgets.
get_grid method: Retrieves the current state of the grid from the tk.Entry widgets.
set_grid method: Updates the tk.Entry widgets with the solved grid.
is_safe method: Checks if placing a number in a given position is valid.
solve_sudoku method: Uses the backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
solve method: Retrieves the current grid, solves the puzzle, and updates the GUI.
Main program: Creates the root window, initializes the SudokuSolverGUI class, and starts the tkinter main loop.

When you run the program, a window will appear with a 9x9 grid where you can input the Sudoku puzzle. Click the "Solve" button to solve the puzzle and display the solution.
